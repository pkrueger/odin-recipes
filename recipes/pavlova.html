      <h2>A light New Zealand dessert you can never get enough of!</h2>
      <p>
        When pavlova was first introduced to me, I immediately fell in love.
        It is an extremely light dessert that make you feel like going back for
        seconds, thirds and even fourths. Make sure to get superfine sugar as it
        will make the meringue smooth instead of grainy with regular sugar. Also,
        I know soaking the strawberries in balsamic vinegar sounds strange but
        it makes them taste incredible afterwards so make sure to do it! We are
        not adding any sweetener to the whipped cream topping so sweet fruits 
        are a must.
      </p>
      <p>Happy eating!</p>

        <li><span>2 tsp</span> cornstarch</li>
        <li><span>A few drops</span> vanilla extract</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>For the topping:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><span>1 lb</span> strawberries, hulled and halved or quartered</li>
        <li><span>1/2 tsp</span> vanilla extract</li>
        <li><span>1 tsp</span> balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li><span>2 tsp</span> caster sugar</li>
        <li><span>2 cups</span> heavy cream</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Equipment</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Electric mixer</li>
        <li>Parchment paper</li>
        <li>Baking sheet(s)</li>
        <li>Oven</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Steps</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 300&#176;F.</li>
        <li>
          Put your egg whites into a clean bowl and whisk them at a medium 
          speed until they start to form nice firm peaks. 
        </li>
        <li>
          With your mixer still running, gradually add the sugar and a pinch of
          sea salt. Turn the mixer up to the highest setting and whisk for 7 to 
          8 minutes more until the meringue is white, glossy and smooth. If it 
          feels grainy, whisk for a little bit longer, being careful not to let 
          the meringue collapse. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Sprinkle in cornstarch, white-wine vinegar and vanilla, and fold in 
          gently.
        </li>
        <li>
          Line two baking trays with baking paper. Divide the meringue mixture 
          evenly between them and shape each blob into a circle about 20cm in 
          diameter. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Put both trays into the oven and bake for 1 hour until the meringues 
          look slightly golden and are fluffy in the middle. 
        </li>
        <li>
          To prepare topping: in a mixing bowl, combine strawberries, vanilla, 
          balsamic vinegar and sugar. Cover with plastic wrap. Let sit at 
          room temperature at least 15 minutes and up to 2 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
          To serve, carefully peel off parchment and place meringue on a 
          platter or cake stand. Gently crack the top with the back of a soup 
          spoon to make a shallow nest for the whipped cream and berries. Whip 
          cream until it is thick enough to hold peaks, and spoon it evenly 
          over meringue. Cover cream with strawberries, allowing a small amount 
          of their liquid to dribble onto cream. Serve immediately.

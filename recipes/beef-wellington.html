      <h3>
        A tricky dish to make right but one of the best you'll ever make!
      </h2>
      <p>When I first made this dish for my wife and parents all of our jaws 
        dropped after our first bite. <br> All of us agreed it was the best thing
        any of us had ever tasted. Tender and juicy tenderloin <br> and a crispy 
        pastry crust with a delectable layer of mushrooms and prosciutto in 
        between. <br> I mean, I'm not even a mushroom guy but this was amazing. 
        Definitely give it a try if you can <br> afford the tenderloin!

      <h4>Steps</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Set Sous Vide to 124&#176;F.</li>
        <li>
          Season beef tenderloin with salt and pepper. Place in vacuum bag or
          resealable ziplock bag.
        </li>
        <li>Submerge and cook for 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Finely chop mushrooms, in food processor or by hand.</li>
        <li>
          Add shallots and garlic to hot pan. Cook until soft. Add chopped 
          mushrooms and cook until all water has evaporated. Add 1 tablespoon 
          of butter and cook until combined. 
        </li>
        <li>Remove beef from bag and pat dry with paper towels.</li>
        <li>
          Heat oil in a cast-iron pan until shimmering. Sear all sides of 
          beef until golden, 30 seconds a side.
        </li>
        <li>Spread dijon mustard all over the tenderloin.</li>
        <li>
          Lay plastic wrap on a surface and arrange prosciutto slices 
          horizontally with each slice slightly overlapping each other.
        </li>
        <li>Spread the duxelles thinly over the prosciutto</li>
        <li>
          Place the tenderloin on top of the duxelles. Slowly roll the 
          tenderloin with the plastic wrap and roll tightly. Place the wrapped 
          tenderloin in the freezer for about 15-20 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Roll out the thawed puff pastry with a rolling pin until smooth.
          Brush the puff pastry with egg wash.
        </li>
        <li>
          Unwrap the tenderloin from the plastic wrap. Place the tenderloin on
          the puff pastry and slowly wrap it. Cut off excess.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place the wellington on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper and
          back at 475&#176;F for about 10 minutes or until the pastry is golden
          brown. 
        </li>
        <li>Slice and enjoy!</li>
